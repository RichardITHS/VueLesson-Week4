- Props
Vue comes with two different ways of storing variables, props and data.

These can be confusing at first, since they seem like they do similar things, and it's not clear when to use one vs the other.

So what's the difference between props and data?

Data is the private memory of each component where you can store any variables you need. Props are how you pass this data from a parent component down to a child component.

- Custom Events
Props are a way to send information to a component that you use.

Sometimes, however, you want to "go the other way", and let a component communicate back/"up" in the hierarchy, to the code that uses the component.

Components can send this type of message via the this.$emit
